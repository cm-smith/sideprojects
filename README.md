## Other Project Ideas
---
Fetch data at discrete time intervals

- Sports, e.g., Mavericks or Stars (because Dallas, ...)
- Weather, esp. for updates about cold NH climate
- Finance, e.g., deals on food (broke college student life)
- Consider using [international statistics](http://inqstats.inqubu.com) for data
  analysis being pulled from an API client (response form: JSON)

Data Analysis

- Make an exploratory project that incorporates dynamic variables and
  visualization to analyze behavior of data in an interactive setting
	- This stems off of iPython's robust toolkit and [a video](www.vimeo.com/79832657) 
	(begins around 32:00 mark) detailing the attractive features available
