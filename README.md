Fetch data at discrete time intervals

- Sports, e.g., Mavericks or Stars (because Dallas, ...)
- Weather, esp. for updates about cold NH climate
- Finance, e.g., deals on food (broke college student life)

Schedule

- *Can I afford it?* decision tree

	- Transportation

Data Analysis

- Make an exploratory project that incorporates dynamic variables and

	- This stems off of iPython's robust toolkit and [a video](www.vimeo.com/79832657) 
	(begins around 32:00 mark) detailing the attractive features available
