# Web Scraping Project

## The Project
---
Got the data from the [ORC
page](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/transcript/medians/) for the past 10 terms.

For the shareable HTML page, I averaged the medians for each course, and also
by the departments as a whole. In the `d_grading.ipynb` that contains the
analysis, you can see a more thorough investigation of the data mining and
analysis.
