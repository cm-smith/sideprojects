### API Project
---
According to ProgrammableWeb, INQStats API offers statistical data about
several countries, including (but not limited to) the following information:

- Population
- Migration Rate
- Education Expenditure
- Health Expenditure
- Number of Internet Users
- Median Age
- Median Wage
- Public Debts
- Life Expectancy

The [website](http://inqstats.inqubu.com) gives an interactive and illustrative
display of the data. This includes heat maps, graph comparisons, rankings
according to topic, and data specific to the countries of interest.

The data is provided by a recently created startup that hopes to become an open
source database and reference source. Thus, the documentation and ease of use
is not very user-friendly yet.
